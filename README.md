# Launch Your Job Search!
<img align="right" width="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdehal/job-search-resources/master/images/UnboxingDoodle.png">The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the job market. After getting laid-off myself in early 2020, I've compiled a list of bookmarks and strategies for tech, design, and web development-related jobs. While many of these jobs are in tech, these strategies (e.g. [setting up alerts](#setup-alerts "setup alerts"), [searching in aggregate](#search-in-aggregate "searching in aggregate")) can be used for any job search.

**I recommend using this page as a launchpad to populate your own bookmarks, setup alerts, and customize a job search strategy that works best for you**!

Note that there will be some overlap with job postings and websites below. Don't let the information overload discourage you!

## Macro View of the COVID-19 Job Market
Remember, you are not alone! Here is a bird's-eye view of the 2020 job market, layoffs, hiring freezes, as well as [some] companies still actively hiring:

## Strategies
#### Numbers Game
The modern job search is a numbers game. You do not have to be a 100% fit for each job requirement if you're a quick learner (keep in mind that [imposter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-do-you-overcome-it/ "imposter") [syndrome](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14684307 "syndrome") is real). Once you find a company or job posting that seems like a good fit:
- **Apply early** (aim to be within the *first* 10-20 applicants — use alerts!)
- **Apply often** (submit 10-20 applications per unique company per week)
- **Apply again** (callbacks after getting rejected and re-applying to the same job posting months later do happen!)

#### Modern Job Boards vs. Legacy
Certain applicant tracking systems (e.g. BrassRing, Taleo, Workday) ask you to upload your resume, while also forcing you to *manually* re-type your entire work history line by line — each application can take 10-20+ minutes (not to mention the carpal tunnel)!

While you should **not** exclude the legacy job boards for their poor UX, the following job boards are significantly *faster* to apply to by merely uploading your resume, checking a few boxes, and clicking submit under 2 minutes! 

Apply to these "quick" modern systems first, and then focus on the older, slower systems.

#### Search in Aggregate
As a bonus, these modern job boards can be easily searched by Google, and *filtered* by your job title (e.g. "Product Designer"), posting date (e.g. "Past Week"), etc.:

You can also search a specific company's job board using Google (e.g.: `site:https://jobs.netflix.com product designer` to seach for `Product Designer` roles at `Netflix`).

:mag_right: [View all postings to **Google's Job Board** (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcareers.google.com%2Fjobs "View all job postings on Google's Career page (Google Search)")

:mag_right: [View all postings to **Facebook's Job Board** (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcareers%2Fjobs "View all job postings on Facebook's Career page (Google Search)")

:mag_right: [View all postings to **Netflix's Job Board** (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fjobs.netflix.com "View all job postings on Facebook's Career page (Google Search)")

#### Setup Alerts
Search for jobs directly in Google and setup *email* alerts on the [Google job portal](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=product+designer+job&ibp=htl;jobs "Google"). You should also setup alerts on your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/?showJobAlertsModal=true "LinkedIn") searches and try to be within the first 10 applicants.

## Social Networking Your Job Search
<img align="right" width="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdehal/job-search-resources/master/images/SelfieDoodle.png">These days, it's difficult, although not impossible to get a job without networking! If you have the connections, do not hesitate to ask your friends or colleagues to *internally* refer you to a job or share your resume with a hiring manager!
#### HackerNews/YC
HackerNews posts separate "Who is Hiring" and "Who Wants to be Hired" threads at 11am Eastern on the first weekday of every month — posting your information will typically get you actual human referrals and attention:

#### LinkedIn
Use your LinkedIn connections and [filter by keyword ](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH "filter your LinkedIn connections") (```human OR hr OR talent OR recruiter```) to narrow down your HR-related connections. Reach out to connections using LinkedIn Messages and remember to send thoughtful "thank you" notes or emails. Lastly, it may be worthwhile to try the free LinkedIn Premium trial for 30 days if you send InMail messages often.
